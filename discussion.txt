Why do YOU think being able to determine the most popular activity and tool from this discussion could be a valuable skill for business intelligence specialists? Because it mirrors real BI work, turning unstructured text into structured insight. Spotting which skills and tools dominate helps prioritize training, hiring, and tech stack decisions. 
How might you go about it? Describe your process:   
Collect all posts into a table (Name, Activities 1–3, Tool-to-learn).

Normalize synonyms (e.g., “dashboard creation” → data visualization; “predictive analytics” → machine learning).

Count frequencies of activities and tools.

(Optional) Visualize with a simple bar chart.

Document assumptions (ties, multi-tool answers).

Estimate the most popular activities selected: Data Viz
Tell us how you arrived at this answer: So far the posts listed, “data visualization” appears in 9 entries. “Data cleaning” and “data analysis” each appear in 6 entries.
Estimate the most popular tool to learn: Tie between Power BI and Spark
Tell us how you arrived at this answer: Counting explicit “Tool YOU want to learn” responses: Power BI (5), Apache Spark (5), Tableau (3), Python (2). One post listed “Power BI or Tableau,” which I counted for both. Normalized “Spark” → “Apache Spark.”

Why do YOU think being able to determine the most popular activity and tool from this discussion could be a valuable skill for business intelligence specialists? This is valuable because it reflects a core part of what BI specialists do — analyzing unstructured data to uncover trends and insights. Being able to identify which tools or activities are gaining the most attention helps professionals and organizations stay aligned with current industry standards and skill demands. It’s essentially turning qualitative discussion data into actionable business intelligence.
How might you go about it? Describe your process: I would gather all responses from the discussion into one document or spreadsheet. Then, I’d perform a keyword frequency analysis to count how often each activity and tool is mentioned. Tools like Python (using pandas and word frequency scripts) or Power BI could help visualize these trends. I might also look for patterns manually, grouping similar phrases (like “data visualization” and “dashboard creation”) to make the insights more accurate.
Estimate the most popular activities selected: Data Cleaning and Data Visualization
Tell us how you arrived at this answer: Many classmates emphasize data cleaning because messy data is one of the biggest challenges in real-world BI work. Data visualization also comes up often since it’s what makes insights understandable and shareable. These two activities are usually top priorities in both academic and professional BI projects.
Estimate the most popular tool to learn: Power BI
Tell us how you arrived at this answer: After reviewing multiple posts, Power BI appears to be the most frequently mentioned tool. It’s popular because it integrates smoothly with other Microsoft products and is widely used across organizations. Even though I personally want to learn Tableau, I can see why Power BI stands out as the most common choice among classmates.

Tool YOU want to learn: Tableau
Why does this tool appeal to YOU for business intelligence: Tableau appeals to me because it combines powerful visual analytics with user-friendly design. I like that it can connect directly to a wide range of data sources and that it’s highly interactive — making it easier to tell meaningful stories with data. In business contexts, visual communication often determines whether insights are acted upon, and Tableau helps bridge that gap. I’ve also noticed many employers value Tableau skills, which makes learning it professionally beneficial.
Tool YOU don't want to learn now: Qlik Sense
Why does this tool not seem as important for YOU to learn right now: While Qlik Sense is a solid BI tool, it’s less common in the environments I’m most interested in. Many organizations I’ve seen use Tableau or Power BI instead, so I’d rather focus my time on tools that align with those systems. Once I’m more comfortable with the mainstream BI platforms, I might explore Qlik later to expand my toolkit.

Why do YOU think being able to determine the most popular activity and tool from this discussion could be a valuable skill for business intelligence specialists? Being able to determine the most popular activity and from this discussion could give insight or different perspective to what tools may be more widely used and what skills that may be more valued in the field.
How might you go about it? Describe your process: Keep up to date with growing tools (Examples: Google Looker or Metabase), as well as researching what skills are being actively requested in relating positions. An example could be as looking for data of job listings and the required/preferred skills. Then, run a count of each instance. I actually did this for the final project in Data Visualization.
Estimate the most popular activities selected: Data Cleaning
Tell us how you arrived at this answer: I'm not quite sure if this is the most "Popular", but data cleaning is the most extensive and ongoing process of the activities. As well as the current climate of companies and relation to data bases is there is a lot of data but its messy, really messy.
Estimate the most popular tool to learn: Power Bi or Apache Spark
Tell us how you arrived at this answer: Reviewed the current responses, as well as from my experience several companies already have transitioned their reporting toward Power BI, and a good amount of jobs posting have Apache Spark as a requested skill.

Tool YOU want to learn: Microsoft Power BI
Why does this tool appeal to YOU for business intelligence: Having raw data is great, but it doesn't do anyone any good without transforming it and adding the story telling piece. At the end of the day, raw data is just numbers. Having a tool for data transformation, analysis, and visualization actually makes the data useful. In my personal experience being in the engineering field, upper management and leadership doesn't care about raw data, they want the numbers to tell a story, or shown in a visual format that is easy to digest and make decisions. It sounds like Power BI is a great tool to do just this. 
Tool YOU don't want to learn now: Looker
Why does this tool not seem as important for YOU to learn right now: I do not work in Google Cloud, so alternatives would personally be better for me. Also, doing some research into Looker, it looks like the learning curve might be a little complex. I'd rather focus on other tools for now.

Tool YOU want to learn: Apache Spark and Python
Why does this tool appeal to YOU for business intelligence: Apache Spark and Python are powerful for Business Intelligence because they allow organizations to handle large and complex datasets more efficiently than traditional BI tools. Python provides flexible data analysis, automation, and machine learning capabilities, while Spark enables fast, scalable processing across large data volumes that exceed Excel or desktop BI limits. Together, they support deeper analytics, real-time insights, and advanced decision-making that go beyond standard reporting dashboards.
Tool YOU don't want to learn now: Looker (Google)
Why does this tool not seem as important for YOU to learn right now: I do not find it appealing to learn Looker (Google) because, I believe many companies find Looker less appealing, the platform requires LookML, a proprietary modeling language that adds a learning curve and limits flexibility compared to SQL- or Python-based tools. It is also seen as more expensive than alternatives like Power BI or Tableau, making it harder for smaller or mid-sized companies to justify. In addition, Looker is tightly integrated with Google Cloud, which can be a drawback for organizations using other cloud ecosystems.

Why do YOU think being able to determine the most popular activity and tool from this discussion could be a valuable skill for business intelligence specialists? It would show the tool or tools that most people are willing to use and help steer me to using the tools that a probably majority of people would be using.
How might you go about it? Describe your process: I would probably create some sort of table in excel to track responses, then count the number of responses and make a determination off the collected data. I'm not sure if I would need to weight the responses to give more bias towards someone's first choice over their third. The biggest downsides are that we would have a small sample size and the majority of us don't have tons of real-world experience, so our views may be skewed toward the open source tools because that is what we can easily afford to learn.
Estimate the most popular activities selected: I'm going to guess the most popular activities will data analysis and data visualization.
Tell us how you arrived at this answer: The simple answer is that data analysis and data visualization are what I believe this course to be about, so the majority of people in the class are probably interested in those two areas in their top three choices.
Estimate the most popular tool to learn: I'm going to guess the answer for most popular tool will be PowerBI
Tell us how you arrived at this answer: It is what the class is about and is the over-arching tool that we will be using. I feel that it is the easy answer for most students to choose and therefore may be the most likely answer.
